        <h2>Gifts</h2>            
        <p>Gifts! Presents! We give them at various times like on birthdays and other holidays.  However, there are others who feel loved when they are blessed with presents. The gifts doesn't have to be extravagant, but giving them unexpectedly and as appreciation, will be welcomed and remembered by those whose love language is associated with receiving gifts.</p>
